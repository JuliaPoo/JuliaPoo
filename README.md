## Heyo! ^-^/ <img src="./rsrc/skykid.svg" style="height:1em">

I'm currently a year ~~1~~ 2 university student, with interest in programming languages and mathematics. I like writing small experimental stuff and occasionally tools. Available for internships~~

You can talk to me at julia.poo.poo.poo@gmail.com

Also I now have an (uncompleted) [website](https://juliapoo.github.io)!
